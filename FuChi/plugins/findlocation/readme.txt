== Description ==
Improves the functionality of the "Find Location" Button. Needs to be used with a theme that supports this plugin. This plugin will replace the functionality of the
reports/geocode controller, so you need to replace the .put url in the reports_edit_js.php. Hope that makes sense.

* Lets you set the region/country results are biased towards
* Lets you add text to the end of a search. For instance you could add ", Mexico" so that all searches are "something, Mexico"
